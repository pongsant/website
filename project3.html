    <h1>Project 3</h1>
    <p> Objective: Create a creative and unique clock that tracks time in a new way.

        Instead of using the usual hours, minutes, and seconds like a regular clock, this project focuses on showing 
        time differently. The goal is to make a clock that is more personal, artistic, or abstract.
        
        For this project, I came up with a clock inspired by the human eye. It has three layers of colors, 
        and each one shows a different unit of time:
        
        - White Layer: Shows the hours.  
        - Grey Layer: Shows the minutes.  
        - Black Layer: Shows the seconds.  
        
        The layers change over time, just like an eye might shift and move. This clock doesnâ€™t just show the time; 
        it also looks artistic and creative as it changes. 
        
        I used simple coding techniques like `if/else` statements to make the layers change. Functions like 
        `millis()`, `second()`, `minute()`, and `hour()` track the time, and the `map()` function helps turn those 
        time values into movements and changes in the clock. 
        
        This project creates a fun and different way to think about and see time!</p>
