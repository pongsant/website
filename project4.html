    <h1>Project 4</h1>
    <p>In Project 4, Description:

        This weekâ€™s lecture was about how optical illusions can hide personal information, messages, or locations. For this project, 
        I made an animated optical illusion using interactive patterns. I was inspired by 
        the importance of patterns in art and culture to create a moving dot design that reacts to user interaction.
        
     My Design:
        - Pattern: The design is made up of dots in three colors: black, grey, and white.
        - Interaction: When you click on a dot, it starts moving in a wave-like motion.
        - Stop Motion: If you click the dot again, it stops moving.
        - Unique Movement: Each dot moves differently, creating a fun and eye-catching effect.
        
        This design shows how optical illusions can make patterns look exciting and puzzling. The interactive part lets the user 
        control the animation, making it feel more personal and engaging. The way each dot moves differently makes the pattern 
        look alive and dynamic.</p>
