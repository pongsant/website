    <h1>Project 1</h1>
    <p>This is Project 1, This assignment involves drawing an object described to us in plain language using code. 
        The goal is to explore how memories and descriptions are interpreted differently when translated into visuals 
        through programming. My partner described an Apple Pencil, and I took on the challenge of coding its representation in p5.js. 
        Initially, I struggled with the unfamiliar syntax and concepts, as this was my first time using p5.js. However, after exploring 
        tutorials and practicing, I managed to create an Apple Pencil using shapes and code. This experience taught me not only the basics 
        of p5.js but also how to break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps to bring ideas to life. </p>
