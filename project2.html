    <h1>Project 2</h1>
    <p>Objective: Create a simple generator that makes different versions of the same design.

        In parameterized design, you guide the process like a conductor leading an orchestra. 
        Instead of drawing each detail of a single design step by step, you use code to set rules and create many 
        variations automatically.
        For Assignment 2, I worked on making a simple generator that changes the look of a face based on how the mouse moves.
         The size of the eyes, the width of the mouth, and the shape of the face all change as you move the mouse around the canvas. 
         The face also reacts to the direction and angle of the mouse, making it more fun and interactive.
        This project helped me understand how parameterized design can make creating variations easier. I also learned how adding interactivity 
        can make designs more exciting. By playing around with different shapes and using the map() function, I created a design thatâ€™s both 
        responsive and fun to explore.</p>
