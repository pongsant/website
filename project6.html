                <strong>Game Project:</strong> <em>Jump and Dodge Adventure</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Jump and Dodge Adventure</em> is a 2D game designed to test players' reflexes and timing skills. 
                The player controls a character that must jump over obstacles while the background dynamically changes as points are earned. 
                The goal is to reach a score of 30 to win while avoiding collisions with incoming obstacles.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Inspiration:</strong> This game was inspired by the Google Dinosaur Game, which appears when there is no internet connection. 
                Its simplicity and addictiveness motivated me to create my own version, adding unique visual and gameplay elements.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Gameplay Mechanics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Player Character:</strong> The player controls P1, who can jump using the space bar.</li>
                <li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> Rocks move from right to left. The player must jump over them to avoid collisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Score System:</strong> Players earn points when obstacles **move off-screen without hitting them.</li>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Avoid obstacles and aim for a high score. Reaching 30 points = WIN, but colliding = GAME OVER.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Development Details:</strong> The game is built in p5.js, utilizing graphics, images, and simple physics for smooth movement and interaction.
