            Game Project: "Jump and Dodge Adventure"

            Overview: "Jump and Dodge Adventure" is a 2D game designed to challenge players' reflexes and timing skills. The main goal of the game is to control a player character who must jump over obstacles while progressing through a dynamic background that changes as the player earns points. Players aim to reach a score of 30 to win while avoiding collisions with incoming obstacles.
            
            Inspiration: This game was inspired by the classic Google Dinosaur Game, which appears on your screen when there is no internet connection. The simplicity and addictive nature of that game inspired me to create my own version, adding new visual and gameplay elements to make the experience unique and memorable.
            
            Gameplay Mechanics:
            - Player Character: The player controls a character named P1. The character can jump to avoid obstacles using the space bar.
            - Obstacles: Rocks appear periodically and move across the screen from right to left. The player must jump over these obstacles to avoid collisions. If a collision occurs, the game ends.
            - Score System: Players earn points when obstacles move off-screen without hitting the player.

            Objective: Survive as long as possible by avoiding obstacles and aiming for a high score. A score of 30 points will result in a win, while a collision with any obstacle will lead to a game over.
            
            Development Details: The game is developed using p5.js, leveraging its capabilities to handle graphics, images, and simple physics for the character's movement.
