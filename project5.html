    <h1>Project 5</h1>
    <p>Objective: Make a data portrait based on one of your personal habits.

        For Assignment 6, I tracked how often I listen to music and the types of 
        music I enjoy. Over a week, I collected data on the genres I listened to and how 
        often I played them. Using this data, I created a self-portrait in p5.js with animation. 
        In the portrait, each color represents a music genre, and the size of the shapes shows how much I listened to that genre.
        
     Process:
        1. Habit Tracked: I tracked how many times I listened to different types of music (like pop, rock, or classical) for a few days.
        2. Data Collection: Each time I listened to music, I wrote down the genre and how often I played it, creating a numbered list.
        3. Visualization: I turned this data into an animated portrait using p5.js:
           - Colors: Each color stands for a different music genre (e.g., blue for pop, red for rock, green for classical).
           - Size: Bigger shapes mean I listened to that genre more often.
           - Animation: The shapes move or pulse, showing the rhythm and energy of my music habits.
        
        How to Read the Data Portrait:
        - The colors show the type of music I listened to.
        - The size of the shapes shows how much I listened to that genre.
        - The animation represents the feeling and rhythm of the music.
        
        This project helped me turn my music-listening habits into a fun and creative artwork.</p>
